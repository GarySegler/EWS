## about_EWS

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Exchange Web Services (EWS) module is a thin wrapper around library,
that allows working with EWS inside PowerShell.

It covers only a part of functionality offered by EWS.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

EWS is web service that makes it relatively easy to automate tasks around
Exchange-hosted mailboxes: both on premise, in the cloud and offered by outlook.com.

In order to work with it you first need to connect to any exchange service.
Once connection is established, service object is saved within module scope.

From this point on you can see folders, items in them, create items of different types.

In essence - sky is the limit!
